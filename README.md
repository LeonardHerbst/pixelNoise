# Pixel Noise - Perlin Noise based pixel art generator
This simple python project generates pixel art using perlin noise. I designed it to quickly generate dirt textures.

At the moment is only uses one layer of perlin noise and maps a color palette to the noise values. 
The dimension of the image, the default color palette (can be changed in the gui), etc. can be changed in the main function in the GroundGenerator.py file.

The UML diagram of the project is in the models folder.
